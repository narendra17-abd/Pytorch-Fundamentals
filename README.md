# Pytorch-Fundamentals

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). 
It is widely used for deep learning tasks and artificial intelligence applications. 
PyTorch provides a dynamic computational graph, allowing for flexible and intuitive model development. 
Key features include tensor operations.
The code is about basic fundamentals of pytorch.
It includes how to check the version also.
The code includes the shaping and dimensions of the tensors.
The dimensions took a lot of time to understand as they were a bit confusing and difficult.
I have understood the purpose of random tensors and how important they are for neural networks and deep learning.
Before learning Pytorch I have learnt differences between ML and DL.
I have learnt about Supervised , Unsupervised and their popular algorithms.
I hope you find this helpful..
